I'll use some of this space to talk about the process of the development of the quiz. I really struggled with this one. As you can see, the JavaScript is inelegant, the style is lazy, and the click events are hardcoded. It's not my finest work. I had extreme problems with the program's logic and it took outside support to get it fixed. But once I got that help and everything worked, it was a very joyous moment. I can only hope that I can code by myself in a way that'll elicit such a response as time goes on.
